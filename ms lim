"Good morning class, good morning 1C," The sharp, loud voice cut through the silence of the classroom as clear as a whistle. The drowsy students, unable to awake from their "zombie" state in the early morning, responded with a "Goooooood moooorniiiiing ms luuuuuullaaaabyyyyy."

"Where's your enthusiasm?" Ms Lullaby scolded, like her usual self. However, the students could not even begin to fathom how she was able to stay so energetic. They rolled their eyes and only repeated the same line louder. Ms Lullaby, barely satisfied, told them to sit down.

"Today's lesson... History of the migrants... They smoked opium blah blah blah..." Just like her name, Ms Lullaby's voice only made the sleepy students want to turn into "sleeping beauties". They were bored out of their mind, and Hisotry being History, was probably the worst of all subjects to start their mornings with, considering none of the students were even fully awake. The hot and humid weather of Singapore and the constant whirring of the ceiling fan didn't help either. 

"Class, stop sleeping! Pay attention!" Ms Lullaby berated the class yet again. The students groaned. "Ms Lullaby, we don't want to take History!" "So boring!" "How to stay awake sia?" Soon, voices of discontent overlapped each other, and the result was a rowdy class full of complaints. Ms Lullaby, who couldn't stand this, just slammed her hand on the whiteboard, gave the class a death glare and continued the lesson. She ignored the snickers and whispers of disdain of some students at her rage.

After the lesson, it was time for English. The students were relieved and delighted to find that History lesson was over. Though a few students felt guilty for making Ms Lulaby particularly provoked that day, they all agreed that they didn't like Ms Lullaby's boring lessons.
